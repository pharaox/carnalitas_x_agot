# Carnalitas Slavery Reimagined AGOT Compatibility

This is a [Carnalitas Slavery Reimagined](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/25565-carnalitas-slavery-reimagined/) compatibility patch for [A Game of Thrones](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2887120253). For an overview of features and other changes, see the README of the main mod.

The latest version is compatible with CK3 1.11.x, Carnalitas 2.2, CSR 0.17.x, and AGOT 0.2.x.

Note that since Carnalitas 2.2 itself is not compatible with AGOT, it is strongly recommended to use also [Carnalitas AGOT Compatibility](?).

## Council and Court Positions

Since AGOT adds new and changes existing council and court positions, one of the main purposes of this compatibility patch is to reconcile these changes.

### Changes to Existing Council and Court Positions

The main CSR mod divides the existing council and court positions into ones that are available to slaves (always or only for certain government forms), and ones that are not available to slaves at all.

#### Council Positions

In addition to the 4 council positions that are available to slaves in CSR, the following AGOT council positions are also available to slaves: *Admiral*, and *Castellan*. The remaining AGOT council positions are not available to slaves, for the following reasons:

* *Personal Steward* is available to the Night's Watch and is therefore incompatible with slavery.
* *Kingsguard* positions are only available to The Iron Throne and are reserved for powerful highborn knights.

In the main CSR mod, *Chancellor*, *Steward*, and *Marshal* are only available to slaves if your government is clan or tribal. In CSR AGOT, they are available to slaves also if your government form is feudal, free city, or pirate. Note that "feudal" governments are mostly found in Essos, the corresponding Westeros government form is "feudal paramountcy".

#### Court Positions

In addition to the 16 court positions that are available to slaves in CSR, the following AGOT court positions are also available to slaves: *Captain of the Household Guard*, *Keeper of the Cells*, *Harbormaster*, *Master-at-Arms*, and *Court Smith*. The remaining AGOT court positions are not available to slaves, for the following reasons:

* *Maester* requires its holder to be a member of the Master's order. It is not clear from the sources if an enslaved Maester can continue to serve as such, so I left it out to be on the safe side.
* *Septon* and *Septa* are religious and therefore incompatible with slavery.
* *Warden of the North*, etc. are only available to The Iron Throne and are practically reserved for powerful vassals holding to corresponding kingships.
* *Commander of the Gold Cloaks* is only available to Kings Landing and is therefore incompatible with slavery.
* Night's Watch positions are only available to the Night's Watch and are therefore incompatible with slavery.

In the main CSR mod, *Cupbearer*, is only available to slaves if your government is clan or tribal. In CSR AGOT, this position, as well as *Harbormaster* and *Master-at-Arms* are available to slaves also if your government form is feudal, free city, or pirate.
